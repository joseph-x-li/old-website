## About

Several of our team members remember when we needed to print magazine size color memes for a school project when we realized we could not locate the closest printer to satisfy our needs. We tried to use the cryptic CMU Printing Services website but were only confused even further. The map and website are hard to read, and the location descriptions are unclear. This is when we decided to create the CMUPrinter app.

## How it Works

Our app uses GPS location services to locate the closest printer that meets the student's specifications (color, print size). It shows the name of the printer, a description of its location, a picture of the printer, and fun facts about the printer's history. It even tells you the approximate distance the student would have to walk to get to the printer.

Printer statuses are scraped online and automatically updated.
