Our platform provides audio synchronization, interactive and browser-compatible sheet music, as well as informative analytics to improve your skillsâ€”all packaged together in a simple yet elegant design.

## How it works

Musicians can join a session that a conductor manages. When the conductor starts the recording session, separate recording sessions are started in each musician's browser. These audio streams are reconstructed in sync and stored. After each recording is finished, the conductor can browse all the recent recordings, listen to them, and get automated algorithmic feedback about tone, timbre, and rhythm.
