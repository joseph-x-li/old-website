## About

Just do your Duolingo lessons so Duo won't come for your family.

## How it works

The script is run daily using a cronjob. It calls Duolingo and Fbchat APIs to check streaks and send messages. Extendible to multiple users.

Random time delays are incorporated to prevent Facebook logging me out of my account.
