## About

In the past, studying bird migrations and populations has always been a articularly grueling tasking, requiring the resercher to manually record bird observations on a spreasheet. Our project seeks to take advantage of the extreme popularity of amateur birdwatching to revolutionalize ornithological research by connecting the data generated by amateur birdwatching to scientists worldwide.

## How it works

Our IOT birdhouse seeks to automate the process of birdwatching. It featrues servos to dispense bird feed for passing birds. A ultrasonic sensor activates a camera to take a picture of the bird in the birdhouse. The images are saved and can be viewed using a website.

The bird house was created using laser-cut acrylic and wood.
