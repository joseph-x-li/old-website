TRADE OF A LIFETIME.
======

Currently sitting on GME 262 shares at average cost $42. 
As of writing, GME sits at $96 (128% return). 

If you were a close WSB follower with decent market knowledge, the insanity currently unfolding should've been as obvious as a fucking lighthouse the power of the Sun, even as GME hovered below 40. Play your options and stocks correctly, you could easily 40x your money by EOW now. A cool $1M bet leading to retirement at 40. 

Over the weekend, I pulled Eddie, Konwoo, Justin, Michael, my brother, and my mom in on this trade. Today will be the spark of insanity, lasting to EOW and even longer. 

The saying goes "You'll be wishing you bought more". I literally pulled all cash I had. All stimulus checks, all funds from venmo, and the random reimbursements back from CMU. My checking account sits at under $200. 

What I truly wish was to convey the conviction to people with more cash. Had I convinced others to enter money on Tuesday and Wednesday, we could be looking at 10-15x returns if we can time the squeeze. 

Premarket currently parked between 90 and 100 after peaking near 130s (All calls ITM AGAIN). Jesus tap-dancing Christ, these shorts are beyond fucked.
