Just finished HackMIT.

We won the NASDAQ challenge for compensating for audio delay in livestreamed music. 

We can now put our picture on the NASDAQ New York Billboard. Kinda weird to see my face in New York. Eddie says he will go take a picture of it (he lives in NJ).

Also, we get to chat with the CTO of NASDAQ. I should think of some good questions to ask.
