Explored possiblity of TGF due to reverse positron beam. 

Used GEANT4 to run particle simulations on UCSC servers using data from UCSC scintillators. Performed statistical data analysis and visualization using R to present results. Paper accepted to JGR: Atmospheres 2020 and presented at AGU Conference 2018.
